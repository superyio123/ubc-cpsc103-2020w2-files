    "#### Step 1: Stub, including signature and purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing I need to think about is the name of the function. I want to choose a meaningful function name. There could be many good choices, but I'll use celsius_to_fahrenheit. Note that it's very specific -- It's important to pick a good function name because we want the name of the function to communicate its behaviour to its reader. If I used something more general like temperature it doesn't help the reader understand what this function does. This is enough to get started on the stub\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def celsius_to_fahrenheit\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I need to think about the signature. What types should this function take in and return? How many inputs does it take? I need to re-read the problem statement and identify the parts of the problem that help me decide what this function takes and returns. \n",
    "\n",
    "It takes a \"a temperature in Celsius\", so I know that it takes exactly one input. I need to choose a name for the parameter that will represent this input. I will choose `degrees_celsius` as it is a meaningful description for what the parameter will represent.\n",
    "\n",
    "What type should I use to represent this input as data in my program? It needs to be a number and I know I can either choose float or int for numbers. The problem statement doesn't say that the temperature must be a whole number and from experience I know that temperatures may not be whole numbers (e.g. 26.2 degrees Celsius) so I'll choose to use a float for the input type.\n",
    "\n",
    "It produces the temperature in Fahrenheit. Since I just decided that the function should take a float (non-integer Celsius temperature), it should be able to produce a float. In fact, even if the function took an int, it would still need to return a float because the conversion from Celsius to Fahrenheit includes multiplying the input by a non-integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we have a bit more information for our stub:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def celsius_to_fahrenheit(degrees_celsius: float) -> float:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now I need to think about the purpose. The problem statement is always a good resource to consult when you're writing the purpose because it tells you what the function should do. In this case, the problem statement says that the function takes a temperature in Celsius and converts it to Fahrenheit. I will use that as my purpose but I will use the parameter name to that it's clear exactly which value will be converted.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def celsius_to_fahrenheit(degrees_celsius: float) -> float:\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    converts degrees_celsius to Fahrenheit\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The last thing to complete is the body of the stub. My signature helps me figure out what the body of the stub should be. The only thing the stub has to do is return a value of the right type. So, for this function I could choose to return any float. I often use 0.0 when I need to return a float in a stub but any other float is equally correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def celsius_to_fahrenheit(degrees_celsius: float) -> float:\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    converts degrees_celsius to Fahrenheit\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    return 0.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "    \n",
    "Finally, I want to add the `@typecheck` annotation to my stub so that the CPSC 103 specific library will check that the arguments that are passed when this function is called are of the right type and that the function is returning the right type. (It uses my signature to do this checking!)\n"

Sometimes it's not simple to come up with the first example and in those cases I will start drawing pictures or diagrams to further understand what the function should do. However, in this case, I can start with an example of converting 1 degree Celsius to Fahrenheit. \n",

In other words, I don't expect the behaviour of the function to change at a specific point; the conversion is always done in the same way. I know I want to include at least two examples so that I can be sure my function is doing the correct calculation and not always returning the same value.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The last important step is to run my program so that I can check that my examples are well-formed. In other words, I want to be sure that my examples don't have any syntax errors. If they do, I want to fix those errors now while the examples are still fresh in my mind. Remember that the purpose of writing a complete function stub is that it allows us to run the examples. \n",
